Pains and lessons of writing a Rosstat data parser.

Someone said there are two ways to obscure statistics: hide it or show too much of it. 
In Russia I think there is a third way: publish it as Microsoft Word files. 
(Well, forth way is PDF files of image scans.)
I'm old enough to remember it when paper publication was the only 
way to obtain the official economic statistics and you had to type in the new digits from a paper book to Excel
(earlier - to SuperCalc, but I'm not that old). 

When Rosstat went on to putting these publications electronically on its web site and for free 
this was a breakthough, but I think it was around 10-15 years ago. The problem is that a book-like "publication" 
still remains a number one distribution channel, and despite allowing some access to databases, 
"витрины данных", open data (and even a strategy for open data) and occasional Excel files. None of that really work 
for you if you want machine-readable time series of Russian macroeconomic data. And then there is FRED,
there getting inflation time series is as easy as typing https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL.
We hate saying something works better in the US, but yes, here it does.
